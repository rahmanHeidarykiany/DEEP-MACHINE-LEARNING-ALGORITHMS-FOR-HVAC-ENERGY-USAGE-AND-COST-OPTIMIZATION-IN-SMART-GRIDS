PhD-projects


This dissertation investigates the application of advanced machine learning
(ML) and optimization methods to enhance the eciency and cost-eectiveness of
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in smart homes. The
research is structured into three main chapters, each addressing dierent aspects
of energy management through innovative technologies and strategies.
The rst part focuses on improving electrical energy demand forecasting
using long short-term memory (LSTM) models. It examines the impact of various
model parameters on forecasting accuracy, nding that certain congurations can
signicantly enhance model performance measured as model accuracy. The research
identies optimal model settings, including layer numbers and batch sizes,
which provide better model performance, which in turn will contribute to more
eective energy management. In the second part, a novel approach to demand
side management (DSM) at the district level is presented. This approach employs
cloud-based technologies and deep learning models to optimize HVAC energy usage,
demonstrating potential energy cost reductions of up to 36% and peak load
reductions up to 9.97%. The strategy involves scheduling HVAC operations within
user-dened comfort levels, facilitated by smart home devices and a dedicated communication
network with energy providers. The third part introduces a Q-Learning
optimization algorithm that incorporates input convex LSTM (ICLSTM) models
within a predictive control framework. This method optimizes HVAC system operations,
achieving a balance between reducing electricity costs and maintaining
user comfort. The algorithm shows an 87% success rate in maintaining desired
temperature setpoints, leading to signicant energy savings.
Overall, this dissertation provides valuable insights into the potential of
ML and optimization techniques to revolutionize energy management in residential
settings. By combining detailed theoretical analysis with practical simulations, it
demonstrates how these technologies can be used to make HVAC systems more
ecient and cost-eective, paving the way for smarter and more sustainable energy
solutions.
